# NetherCoords
A simple plugin that has a command that converts nether coordinates to overworld coordinates and vice-versa

An alias is /convertcoords

Currently has no permission (I honestly don't think it requires one but I guess I could?).

Examples:

**Nether to Overworld**

**Overworld to Nether**
